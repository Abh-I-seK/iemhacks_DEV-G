- User Account Creation: Users can create accounts with OTP verification for enhanced security.
- Course Purchasing: Users can conveniently purchase courses through the integrated Razorpay payment gateway.
- Security Enhancements: SHA-256 and HMAC algorithms are utilized to provide robust data security.

## Technologies Used
- MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js form the core of the application.
- Razorpay: Integrated for secure payment processing.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dev-g-edtech.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd dev-g-edtech`
3. Install dependencies for the server: `cd server && npm install`
4. Configure environment variables: Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your configuration details.
5. Start the server: `cd ../server && npm start`
